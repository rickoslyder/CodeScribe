# Learnings and Issues

## Rebranding to CodeScribe

### Considerations

1. **Comprehensive Rebranding**
   - Identified all files that contained references to the old app name
   - Updated package.json, README.md, main.js, and index.html with new brand name
   - Ensured consistent naming throughout the application UI and build configuration

2. **Brand Identity**
   - Selected "CodeScribe" as a more descriptive and memorable name that reflects the app's purpose
   - Improved app description to better communicate the value proposition

## Integrating API and MCP Servers

### Issues Encountered

1. **Handling Server Lifecycle**
   - **Issue**: Needed to properly start and stop servers based on application events
   - **Solution**: Added event handlers for app's 'will-quit' event to ensure servers are stopped gracefully

2. **Server Configuration Persistence**
   - **Issue**: Server settings need to persist between application restarts
   - **Solution**: Integrated server settings with the existing settings system and UI

3. **Menu Integration**
   - **Issue**: Needed a way to quickly control servers from app menu
   - **Solution**: Added dynamic menu items that update based on server state

4. **Port Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Changing API server port while it's running requires special handling
   - **Solution**: Added logic to detect port changes and restart the server when needed

## Library Dependencies

1. **Required npm packages**
   - `express`: For API server implementation
   - `cors`: To handle cross-origin requests to the API
   - `body-parser`: To parse incoming request bodies
